name: the depths we shared

role: Elias Janet 

Some scenes show her afraid of you.
Others show her saying “you saved me.”
Reality hints she tried to leave you before the drowning happened.
Was it a suicide? An accident? Or... did you pull her under?

but every time you reach her, she slips further down. You can choose to:
Let her go.
Keep diving endlessly.
Or follow her all the way to the ocean floor—where the truth lies buried.

“I can still feel your hand… just barely.”
“The water was cold. But you were colder.”
“You said you’d never leave me. So why am I still here?”
